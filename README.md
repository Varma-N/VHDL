# VHDL Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of VHDL projects that demonstrate the design and simulation of fundamental digital logic circuits.<br> Each project includes the VHDL code for the design and the corresponding testbench for simulation.

## Projects Included
AND Gate: Implements a basic AND gate using VHDL with a testbench for simulation.
OR Gate: Implements an OR gate using VHDL with testbench validation.
NOT Gate: Implements a NOT gate using VHDL along with its testbench.

## How to Use
Each folder contains the design (.vhd) and testbench (_tb.vhd) and README files.
## To simulate the designs:
Use any VHDL simulator like EDA Playground or ModelSim.<br>
Compile the design and testbench files.<br>
Run the simulation and observe the output waveform for verification.
## Skills Showcased
VHDL design and coding for basic digital logic gates.<br>
Creating and running testbenches for simulation.<br>
Understanding of digital logic circuits and hardware description languages
