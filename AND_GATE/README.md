# AND Gate VHDL Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple AND gate using VHDL. The design includes both the AND gate entity and a corresponding testbench to verify its functionality.

## Files
- `AND_GATE.vhd`: VHDL code for the AND gate.
- `AND_GATE_tb.vhd`: Testbench for the AND gate, which applies various test vectors and checks the output.

## Description
### AND Gate
The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that outputs true (1) only if both of its inputs are true (1). The VHDL implementation describes the behavior of the AND gate using a structural approach.

### Testbench
The testbench simulates the AND gate by applying all possible combinations of its two inputs and checking the corresponding output. It includes assertions to validate the output against expected results.

## Simulation Instructions
1. Open the project in [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/).
2. Select a simulator (e.g., GHDL or Modelsim).
3. Ensure both `AND_GATE.vhd` and `AND_GATE_tb.vhd` files are included for simulation.
4. Click on the **Run** button to start the simulation.
5. Check the console output for any assertion errors. If all tests pass, you will see no error messages.

## Results
Here is the result of the simulation:

## Usage
This project can be used as a learning resource for students and beginners who want to understand VHDL design and simulation. It can also serve as a foundational example for more complex digital logic designs.
