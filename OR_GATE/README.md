# OR Gate VHDL Design
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the VHDL implementation of a basic OR gate. The OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that outputs a high (1) if at least one of its inputs is high (1). The design is written in VHDL and includes both the design code and a testbench to verify the functionality.

## Files Included
OR_GATE.vhd: VHDL code for the OR gate design.<br>
OR_GATE_tb.vhd: Testbench code to simulate and verify the OR gate functionality.<br>

## OR Gate Logic
The OR gate follows the following truth table:

|Input A |	Input B |	Output|
|--------|--------|---------|
|0	     |0         |	0     |
|0	     |1         |	1     |
|1	     |0         |	1     |
|1	     |1         |	1     |

## Simulation Results

## How to Run the Simulation
Design Code: Use the OR_GATE.vhd file for the OR gate logic implementation.<br>
Testbench: The testbench file OR_GATE_tb.vhd is provided to verify the functionality of the OR gate.<br>
EDA Playground: You can run and simulate this design using platforms like EDA Playground or your local simulator.

# Conclusion
The OR gate is successfully implemented in VHDL, and the functionality is verified using the provided testbench.<br>You can find both the design and the testbench files in this repository.
