## NOT Gate VHDL Design
This folder contains the VHDL code and testbench for a NOT gate. The NOT gate outputs the logical inversion of the input.

# Files Included
NOT_GATE.vhd: This is the VHDL design file for the NOT gate.<br>
NOT_GATE_tb.vhd: This is the testbench file used to simulate and verify the NOT gate design.<br>
# How to Use
Design File: Use NOT_GATE.vhd to implement the NOT gate.<br>
Testbench: Use NOT_GATE_tb.vhd to simulate the NOT gate and verify its functionality.<br>
Run Simulation: Run the files using a VHDL simulator like EDA Playground.<br>

# Truth Table for NOT Gate
|Input A	| Output Y|
|---------|---------|
|  0      |	  1     |
|  1	    |   0     |

# Result
The waveform shows the expected behavior of the NOT gate.

The output is '1' when the input is '0', and '0' when the input is '1'.
